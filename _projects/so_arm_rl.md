This project focuses on training a robotic arm using Reinforcement Learning, specifically the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, within the NVIDIA Isaac Lab simulation environment.

## Overview

The So-Arm project demonstrates the application of modern deep reinforcement learning techniques to robotic manipulation tasks. By leveraging Isaac Lab's physics simulation capabilities and PPO's sample-efficient learning, we can train complex robotic behaviors in simulation before deploying to real hardware.

## Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- **Simulation Environment**: NVIDIA Isaac Lab
- **Task**: Robotic arm manipulation and control
