This project focuses on training a robotic arm using Reinforcement Learning, specifically the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, within the NVIDIA Isaac Lab simulation environment.

## Overview

The SO-101 Arm RL Controller project demonstrates the application of modern deep reinforcement learning techniques to robotic manipulation tasks. I trained a PPO policy in Isaac Lab with custom reward shaping and am currently implementing deployment on real hardware for multi-pose execution.

## Technical Details

- **Algorithm**: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with custom reward shaping
- **Simulation Environment**: NVIDIA Isaac Lab
- **Task**: Robotic arm manipulation and control
- **Status**: Currently implementing deployment on real hardware for multi-pose execution
