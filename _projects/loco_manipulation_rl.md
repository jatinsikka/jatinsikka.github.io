This project explores loco-manipulation—the combined task of locomotion and manipulation—by integrating reinforcement learning with a pretrained AMO controller in the MuJoCo physics simulation environment.

## Overview

Loco-manipulation is a challenging problem in robotics that requires coordinating both the robot's movement (locomotion) and its manipulation capabilities. This project leverages a pretrained AMO controller as a foundation and uses reinforcement learning to adapt and improve performance for specific manipulation tasks.

## Technical Approach

- **Simulation Environment**: MuJoCo
- **Base Controller**: Pretrained AMO (Any Motion) Controller
- **Learning Method**: Reinforcement Learning
- **Task**: Combined locomotion and manipulation
