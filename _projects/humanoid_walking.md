This project implements forward, backward, and sideways walking capabilities for humanoid robots using DCM-based trajectory planning.

## Overview

Multi-directional walking is essential for humanoid robots to navigate complex environments. This project demonstrates the implementation of walking patterns in multiple directions using the DCM Planner framework.

## Walking Modes

### Forward Walking
Forward walking is the most common and natural walking pattern for humanoid robots.

### Backward Walking
Backward walking requires careful balance management and is useful for navigation in tight spaces.

### Sideways Walking
Sideways walking enables lateral movement, which is important for obstacle avoidance and precise positioning.
