An integrated framework that combines artificial intelligence, machine learning, and control systems for advanced robotics applications.

## Overview

This framework integrates AI/ML capabilities with traditional control systems to enable more intelligent and adaptive robotic behaviors. The combination allows robots to learn from experience while maintaining the stability and reliability of control-theoretic approaches.

## Key Components

- **AI/ML Module**: Machine learning algorithms for perception, decision-making, and adaptation
- **Controls Module**: Traditional control systems for stability and safety
- **Integration Layer**: Seamless combination of both approaches
