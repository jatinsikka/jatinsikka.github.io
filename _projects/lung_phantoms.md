Development and testing of lung phantoms for medical device testing, calibration, and validation purposes.

## Overview

Lung phantoms are physical models that simulate the mechanical properties and behavior of human lungs. They are essential for testing and validating medical devices such as ventilators, respiratory monitors, and diagnostic equipment.

## Project Goals

- Design and fabricate realistic lung phantoms
- Validate mechanical properties against real lung tissue
- Test medical devices in controlled conditions
